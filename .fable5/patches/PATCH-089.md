## 0. Census at authoring (2026-07-19, from `22d3f1f`)

| # | Candidate | Class | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Container-drop non-atomic relationship updates (cluster ~307/487/496/520)** | defect family (production) | **SELECTED — diagnosis first (this patch)**; statically proven hazards (§1) but runtime reachability/semantics unproven; fix would be speculative without evidence |
| 2 | Parent `childPadletIds` / child `parentId` consistency + orphan/half-link states | defect states | the SUBJECT of #1's characterization (§2 invariant vs current behavior) |
| 3 | Silent catches + rollback/compensation ordering in the cluster | defect mechanics | recorded statically (§1/§5); runtime confirmation via Flow D/E |
| 4 | Remaining non-strict `onUpdatePadlet` callers (positions ~932/942; comments ~1939) | defect family | positions: intentionally best-effort (DEFER by design ruling, 088 §4); comments: HIGH severity but store-duality-entangled (Phase 3) — after the cluster |
| 5 | Broader seven-site canvas-ops error swallowing + Result/throw consistency | design | later dedicated patch; decisions-table entry stands |
| 6 | PATCH-081 | RETIRED-BY-NOTE (confirmed) | spec untouched/green; deep-clone spec authoritative; no acceptance gate depends on the stale label; no bundling |
| 7 | Frame/sidebar geometry/position sync | no characterized defect | 079/080 green post-085/086; deferred unless a repro appears |
| 8 | Line-follow | hardening | deferred |
| 9 | Uploaded-image storage cleanup | hardening | deferred |
| 10 | AI images in presentation | feature | deferred (fixture-blocked) |
| 11 | Overlap fallback | hardening | low, deferred |
| 12 | Connections side-panel planning | feature | deferred |
| 13 | New issue exposed by 088 | — | NONE (review PASS; runner exercised its bounded branch under a real incident without masking) |

## 1. Exact defect surface (bind — statically proven; runtime
evidence is this patch's product)

All four cluster sites live in `DrawingLayout.tsx` (blob
`a2fb3ae…`, FENCED — read-only this patch):

1. **~307 (library-item drop into container card):** create child
   row (`parentId` set at creation) → append to container
   `childPadletIds` via NON-STRICT `onUpdatePadlet` — the entire
   sequence is wrapped in `catch { /* silent */ }`, which would
   swallow even a thrown failure. Failure → created row exists but
   no parent references it (ORPHAN on reload).
2. **~487/​~496 (drag existing card into container —
   `onDropExistingPadlet`):** TWO sequential non-strict writes:
   append to new parent's `childPadletIds`, then set child
   `parentId`. Non-atomic; either half can silently fail
   (half-linked state). **CRITICAL STATIC FINDING:** the handler
   NEVER removes the child from a PREVIOUS parent's
   `childPadletIds`; the drop target
   (`RowColumnContainerCard.tsx` ~314–319, FENCED... NOT in the
   fence list — read-only regardless) only guards self-drop and
   same-container duplicates. If a drag can be initiated from a
   card already inside another container, a move A→B leaves the
   child referenced by BOTH parents with `parentId = B`
   (duplicate-parent state). Whether that drag is actually
   drivable in the drawing layout is UNPROVEN — a core question of
   this diagnosis.
3. **~520 (draft drop into container):** create row (parentId at
   creation) → append to container list via non-strict update —
   same orphan hazard as #1 (no site-level silent catch here, but
   the void channel swallows everything anyway).

Persistence channels available for a future fix (recorded at §5):
strict throwing channel `onUpdatePadletStrict` already passed to
DrawingLayout (086); `onAddPadlet` throws on create failure;
`onDeletePadlet` available for compensation — a MODEL A fix can
stay inside DrawingLayout.

## 2. Bound relationship invariant (product ruling — the TARGET;
this diagnosis measures the current gap)

- `parent.childPadletIds` contains the child id ⟺
  `child.metadata.parentId` equals that parent id (BOTH or
  NEITHER persist — never a half-link);
- a child has AT MOST ONE parent (multi-parent is NOT supported);
- `childPadletIds` order is preserved;
- moving a child between parents REMOVES it from the old parent
  and ADDS it to the new one, atomically-or-compensated;
- a failed move leaves the ORIGINAL relationship intact;
- a failed add leaves NO orphan row;
- no duplicate child references;
- local UI reflects confirmed persistence, or an explicit
  optimistic-rollback contract (none exists today).

**Bound transactional TARGET model: MODEL A — persistence-first
with compensation** (the 086 precedent: persist all relationship
writes via throwing channels, confirm, mutate local scene/UI only
after confirmation, compensate intermediate writes on failure).
MODEL B (optimistic + deterministic rollback) is REJECTED as the
target — no rollback contract exists and building one is broader
than the MODEL A path. Implementation is NOT authorized here; the
PATCH-090 fix must bind to this invariant unless this diagnosis
disproves an assumption.

## 3. Bound failure-mode inventory (static; runtime columns are
this patch's output)

| # | Mode | Statically expected current behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | child create ok, parent append fails | orphan row; silent (site 1: even throws swallowed) |
| 2 | parent append ok, child `parentId` fails | parent lists child, child unowned; silent |
| 3 | old-parent removal | DOES NOT EXIST — moves never remove from old parent |
| 4 | child reparented, old parent still lists it | structurally guaranteed on any cross-container move |
| 5 | local UI updated, persistence failed | hook-level silent rollback ⇒ reload divergence |
| 6 | rollback attempt fails | no rollback exists at cluster sites |
| 7 | duplicate child reference | same-container guarded at drop target; cross-container NOT guarded |
| 8 | rapid repeated drop | unserialized async handlers; interleaving unproven |
| 9 | drag cancel after partial persistence | no cancellation handling |
| 10 | reload after partial failure | renders whatever half-state persisted |

## 4. Diagnosis matrix (bind) and the new spec

ONE new spec `e2e/characterization/drawing-container-drop.spec.ts`
(ONE active test, up to THREE sequential disposable boards,
existing harness only, `registerDrawingCleanup(test)` at module
scope, per-board try/finally + zero-assertion,
`test.setTimeout(420_000)`; bound prefixes
`patch-064-harness-patch-089-drop-a-` / `-b-` / `-c-`).

This is an OBSERVATIONAL diagnosis: outcomes are RECORDED in bound
annotation fields, not asserted as product-correct. Per flow, if
the driving user action proves NOT drivable through the real UI
(e.g., no drag source exists in the drawing layout), record the
bound value `action-not-drivable` for that flow WITH the probing
evidence — that is a valid diagnostic result, NOT a failure.

- **Flow A (board a)** — drop an existing card into a container
  through the real UI (HTML5 drag of a card exposing
  `text/padlet-id` onto the container drop zone). Record: both
  relationship directions in settled persistence
  (`parent.childPadletIds` contains child; `child.parentId` ==
  parent), reload state, and whether each direction persisted.
- **Flow B (board b)** — move a child from container A to
  container B (if drivable). Record: whether A still lists the
  child (the §1 duplicate-parent hazard), whether B lists it,
  `child.parentId`, reload state, count of parents referencing the
  child.
- **Flow C (board c)** — rapid repeated drop/move (≤5 s apart).
  Record: final reference counts, duplicate references, settled
  consistency.
- **Flow D (all boards)** — passive wire ordering (084/085
  method): record the parent/child PATCH sequence, payload field
  presence (childPadletIds vs metadata.parentId), and 2xx
  statuses. No `page.route`, no auth capture.
- **Flow E (source inspection, recorded in the patch review — not
  browser-driven)** — the §1/§3 static findings; the reviewer
  re-derives them from the fenced sources.
- **Flow F (all boards)** — per-board cleanup zero-assertions
  (`assertDrawingFixtureCleanup` 0/0/0) — no orphan rows escape
  the fixtures even when half-links are recorded.

Bound classification field (single, derived in bound order):
`drop-persists-consistently` |
`drop-half-link-observed` |
`move-leaves-duplicate-parent` |
`action-not-drivable` |
`mixed-drop-state`.

## 5. Allowed files (bind)

| File | Role | Starting state at base `22d3f1f` |
|---|---|---|
| `e2e/characterization/drawing-container-drop.spec.ts` | NEW diagnosis spec | absent at base (absence gate) |

ONE file. NO production file is authorized. Absence gates: the new
spec absent at base and worktree before implementation;
`e2e/characterization/drawing-slide-persistence.spec.ts` AND
`.fable5/patches/PATCH-077-draft.md` permanently absent at base,
HEAD, and worktree; PATCH-090 not started.

## 6. Immutable fences (bind — 37, Git blob IDs)

Verify each with `git rev-parse 22d3f1f…:<path>` and equality at
the current governance HEAD. Blob-ID method only. The 088 fence set
PLUS the landed runner.

```

## 7. Expected totals (bind)

New spec: **2 passed with dependencies / 1 passed `--no-deps` /
2 skipped credential-off** (setup + one active test), THREE
sequential stable dependency runs — recorded VALUES must be
coherent across runs; `action-not-drivable`, if it occurs, must be
deterministic (same flows, all three runs). Carried: all 14
existing specs' totals UNCHANGED (run via the PATCH-088 grouped
runner; any auth-expiry incident uses the runner's bounded
recovery and is reported as infrastructure). Deterministic: helper
7/1; sanitizer 9/1; focused drawing 59/2; full Vitest **448/43**;
diff-check/tsc/boundaries/sequential verify+build green; zero
production imports; 37/37 fences. Cleanup zeros across
**THIRTY-TWO** prefixes (the twenty-nine tracked plus this patch's
three §4 prefixes).

## 8. Environment contract (binding, unchanged)

Self-started `npm run dev -- --port 3000` + explicit `PW_BASE_URL`;
port discipline; auth refresh only via `--project=setup` or the
PATCH-088 runner's bounded recovery; no credential contents;
passive listeners only (no `page.route`, no auth headers);
sequential `verify`/`build`, never under a dev server; never
commit generated artifacts.

## 9. Stop conditions

STOP immediately, report, do not commit, if:

- base commit, any §6 fence (37/37), or any §5 absence gate differs;
- the diagnosis requires ANY production edit, harness edit, config
  edit, second file, failure injection, or instrumentation seam;
- driving a flow requires simulating DOM events synthetically in a
  way that bypasses the real drop-zone handlers (record
  `action-not-drivable` instead — do NOT fabricate the action);
- recorded values are incoherent across the three runs;
- any carried spec's totals change;
- cleanup cannot reach zero for any board.

## 10. Review and commit flow (bind)

Implementer delivers the uncommitted ONE-file diff + report (blob
re-derived; per-flow recorded values; three-run stability; carried
totals via the runner; deterministic totals; fence result; cleanup
proof). The independent read-only reviewer re-derives everything,
re-runs the spec three times, re-derives the §1 static findings
from the fenced sources, and must return an explicit PASS before
the implementer commits with the bound message and pushes. CTO
closes with the container-drop fix ruling (PATCH-090 candidate)
based on the recorded evidence.

## 11. Required final report

Exact one changed path + final blob; per-flow recorded values and
classification; duplicate-parent verdict (observed / not-drivable /
consistent); wire-order evidence; three-run stability; carried
totals; deterministic totals; 37-fence result + absence gates;
cleanup across thirty-two prefixes; explicit confirmations (no
production/harness/config change, no injection, no seam, no auth
capture); commit hash + push status after PASS.

## 12. Closure record (CTO, 2026-07-19)

**Landed:** commit `92d742f27c550cf3d62b6ad8a1563b0ad09de5a2`
(`test(e2e): characterize container-drop relationship persistence
(PATCH-089)`), exactly one new file
`e2e/characterization/drawing-container-drop.spec.ts`, blob
`32750636c1146f5bf8da3e7f9987838b26c5169b` (683 lines).
Independent read-only review: **PASS** (all 23 tasks re-derived
live: repository state, 37/37 fences at base AND governance HEAD,
absence gates, full-file architecture audit, live spec executions
with annotation capture ×2 byte-identical, three sequential
dependency-backed runs, carried runner, deterministic gates,
scope/cleanup/artifact audits).

### Diagnosis result (bound)

**Selected real action:**
`toolbar-note-editor-save-placement-prompt-add-to-existing-ghost-drag`
— visible Note toolbar button → NoteEditor → overlay save →
PlacementPrompt → "Add to Existing" → native HTML5 drag of the
rendered ghost onto the visible container card. Genuinely driven
(Playwright `dragTo` of visible elements); no callback invocation,
no custom event dispatch, no hidden-handler access, no direct
state mutation, no `page.evaluate` internals call.

- **Flow A (drop):** DRIVABLE. Child created; settled persistence
  showed `parent.childPadletIds` contains child AND
  `child.parentId` == parent; reload preserved BOTH directions;
  child rendered in destination; no orphan; duplicate-parent
  count 1. Per-flow classification `drop-persists-consistently`.
- **Flow B (cross-container move):** **action-not-drivable** —
  honestly recorded. The existing child rendered inside
  `RowColumnContainerCard` exposes NO draggable ancestor carrying
  `text/padlet-id` (read-only DOM probe evidence recorded). No
  hidden handler, no synthetic event, no persistence bypass was
  used. NO runtime duplicate-parent claim was made.
- **Flow C (repeat):** DRIVABLE. Repeated real action persisted
  consistently; reload preserved consistency; no product-action
  retry; duplicate-parent count 1.

**Passive wire order for driven drops (both A and C, stable):**
1. child create `POST /rest/v1/padlets` → **201** (payload carries
   `parentId`; ~0.4s);
2. parent `childPadletIds` `PATCH` → **204** (~0.5s);
3. child `parentId` `PATCH` → **204** (~2.7s, the content-save
   debounce window).

**No old-parent removal write was observed in any flow.** All-2xx
sequences do NOT imply atomicity — the three writes are separate
requests with independent failure points. Runtime evidence and
source-inspection evidence were kept strictly separate in the
recorded annotations (`sourceInspectionFindings` labeled
`statically-derived-from-DrawingLayout` vs
`runtimeObservedFindings`).

### Source-derived findings (re-confirmed at closure)

- **Library-drop (header-strip fallback, ~292–311):** child
  creation precedes parent append; the entire sequence sits in
  `catch { /* silent */ }`; a parent-append failure leaves an
  orphan (created row, no parent reference).
- **Existing-card drop (~482–499):** new-parent append and child
  `parentId` update are TWO sequential writes, both on the
  NON-STRICT void channel; no old-parent removal path exists
  anywhere; failure visibility is absent. Cross-container
  duplication remains structurally possible but was NOT
  runtime-proven because the move action is not drivable.
- **Draft-drop (~501–526):** child creation precedes parent
  append; same orphan hazard (no site catch; the void channel
  swallows regardless).

### Final classification (bound): `mixed-drop-state`

Meaning, precisely: Flows A and C persisted consistently; Flow B
was `action-not-drivable`; NO runtime duplicate-parent claim was
made. The diagnosis established (1) partial UI drivability of the
container-drop surface and (2) the exact persistence ordering a
PATCH-090 fix must protect.

**Non-blocking reviewer observation (recorded, not actioned):**
when the visible ghost is consumed but no child row is
subsequently found, the spec falls back to `action-not-drivable`
rather than a distinct "drivable-but-unpersisted" value. That
branch did NOT occur in any accepted run and did not affect
acceptance. It must NOT be silently converted into production
evidence; tighten only in a future spec revision if the branch
ever fires.

### Final verification (accepted totals)

- Focused: dependency mode **2 passed**; `--no-deps` **1 passed**;
  credential-off **2 skipped**; THREE sequential dependency-backed
  runs all passed with byte-identical classification/drivability
  data across independent annotation captures; JSON reporter pass
  succeeded and output was removed.
- Carried: PATCH-088 grouped runner — **14/14 groups passed,
  14/14 specs accounted for, 0 auth-expiry incidents,
  0 non-signature failures**, exit 0.
- Deterministic: `git diff --check` clean; tsc clean; boundaries
  clean; slideOrder **7/1**; clonedPostMetadata **9/1**; focused
  drawing **59/2**; full Vitest **448/43**; `npm run verify`
  green; `npm run build` green (sequential, no dev server).
- Cleanup: all three PATCH-089 prefixes reached boards 0 /
  padlets 0 / canvasLines 0 in every run; no orphan child rows;
  `test-results/.last-run.json` confirmed ignored/generated and
  removed before commit; no artifacts remain; ports 3000/4000
  free.

### Exclusions preserved

No production change; no harness change; no Playwright config
change; no existing-spec change; no package/lockfile change; no
new dependency; no hidden-handler call; no synthetic drag/drop
bypass; no request/response modification; no failure injection;
no auth material captured. Prohibited paths remained absent.
